# CodeReviewTest

This test is based on the exercise from this repository: https://github.com/Tarcaye/code-review-interview

## Steps for creating the test

1. Create a PR from branch ``feature/basket-informations`` to ``master`` and put your name in the title.
2. Start a review with the comments you think need to be added

### Info
* There may be other candidates branches with PRs and comments. We cannot force that you don't check them, but we're more 
interested to see what you write and how you communicate in a CR environment. Part of the CR is done during the next 
interview with the team.
* You don't need to point out every mistake if you don't want. We will not check quantity, but which and why.
